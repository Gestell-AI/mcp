# Gestell MCP Workflows

Make sure to run all the workflows using `GESTELL_MCP_SERVICE_TYPE="TERMINAL"`

- [Simple Modality Workflow](./simple.ts): Ideal when you just want to search or prompt an existing collection

- [Create & Manage Collection Workflow](./management.ts): When you want an agent to create and upload documents

- [Query Workflow](./query.ts): How to query collections and documents

- [Extract Features and Tables Workflow](./extractions.ts): When you want an agent to extract features from a collection post processing

Heavily recommend you run through the <https://github.com/Gestell-AI/guides> repository to make sure you can run all workflows above easily.

Please open an issue if you would like to a certain type of workflow demonstrated or if workflows are unclear.
